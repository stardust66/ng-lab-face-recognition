# Engineering Lab Facial Recognition
Raspberry Pi that greets people at the entrance of the engineering lab using
facial recognition. Still in the preliminary stage.

## Setup
You need to have python 3 installed. This repository uses git-lfs, so you
should probably get it too, here: https://git-lfs.github.com/. You should also
download pretrained facenet models from
https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet#pre-trained-models, unzip them, and
place them under the `saved_models` top level directory. Then run:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/StPauls-Computer-Science/ng-lab-face-recognition.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The audio component depends on `mpg321`, so install that with your favorite
package manager.

## Running Recognition
You should first generate a database of embeddings with
```
python create_database.py (output_file) (input_directory) (image_filenames)
```
Then, you can run real-time camera facial recognition with your webcame by
running
```
python camera_recognize.py (database_path)
```
where `database_path` refers to the path to the file you just generated. The
filenames will be used as labels (people's names), so name your files
appropriately.

## Notebook
In the notebook `Facial Recognition with FaceNet.ipynb`, I've been exploring
the embeddings and building a simple face recognizer.

#### A Note About Test Images
I've provided three pictures of myself and Sam Henderson, who agreed to have
his pictures put online. For other pictures referenced in the notebook, just
find some pictures online or get some from Google Images.

## Visualizing the saved model
```
python log_saved.py
tensorboard --logdir logs/facenet-pretrained-log
```
Will give you cool graph visualizations in tensorboard so you can explore
the model visually.

## Acknowledgements
I'm using David Sandberg's implementation of FaceNet (included as a submodule)
and his pretrained weights. I'm also using OpenFace's wrapper around dlib's
face detection and alignment. [OpenFace](http://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/)
is an open source face recognition module developed by Carnegie Mellon. To find
out more about FaceNet, read the original paper on arxiv [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832)
