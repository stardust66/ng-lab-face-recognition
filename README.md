# Engineering Lab Facial Recognition
Raspberry Pi that greets people at the entrance of the engineering lab using
facial recognition. Still in the preliminary stage.

## Dependencies
See `requirements.txt`. Many of the requirements are inherited from
https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet

## Notebook
In the notebook `Embeddings_Test.ipynb`, I've been exploring the embeddings
and building a simple face recognizer. If the GitHub notebook viewer doesn't
work, use jupyter's [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and paste in the
notebook URL or click [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/StPauls-Computer-Science/ng-lab-face-recognition/blob/master/Embeddings_Test.ipynb).

## Visualizing the saved model
```
python log_saved.py
tensorboard --logdir logs/facenet-pretrained-log
```
Will give you cool graph visualizations in tensorboard so you can explore
the model visually.
